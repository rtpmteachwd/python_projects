Im going to build a tic tac toe game 3 x 3
- 2 players (1 cpu, 1 real player)
- program will stop once one of the player wins
- the characters to enter are x and o
- player1 and playercpu will take turns in playing the game
- the decision to whoever will start is through getting a random number which is high one is higher
- implement loops (for or while)in creating the logic
- implement functions for reusability of code
